# LendingClub-Loan-Repayment-Prediction
We will use publicly available data from LendingClub.com to build a model that predicts whether or not a borrower will repay their loan in full. The data includes information about the borrower's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors.

The columns in the dataset represent the following:

credit.policy: Whether the borrower meets LendingClub.com's credit underwriting criteria.
purpose: The purpose of the loan (e.g., credit card debt consolidation, educational expenses, etc.).
int.rate: The interest rate of the loan.
installment: The monthly payment amount.
log.annual.inc: The natural log of the borrower's annual income.
dti: The debt-to-income ratio.
fico: The borrower's FICO credit score.
days.with.cr.line: The length of time the borrower has had a credit line.
revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance.
revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate.
inq.last.6mths: The number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
pub.rec: The number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).
not.fully.paid: Whether the borrower repaid their loan in full (0) or not (1).
The data is from 2007-2010, so it may not be representative of the current lending environment. However, it is a valuable resource for understanding the factors that affect a borrower's likelihood of repayment.
