## üè¶ LendingClub Loan Repayment Prediction Project üöÄ

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan repayment using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data from LendingClub, the goal is to build a robust model to predict whether a borrower will repay the loan or default.

## Problem Statement
Given historical loan data, including information on borrowers' repayment behavior, the challenge is to create a predictive model that accurately determines whether a borrower will successfully repay the loan or default.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection:** Gather comprehensive data from LendingClub, including features such as credit score, loan amount, interest rate, and borrower information.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and potential influencing factors.
3. **Model Development:** Utilize machine learning algorithms, such as Sequential Neural Networks, to build a predictive model for loan repayment.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow (Sequential Neural Networks)
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Project Structure
- **/data:** Contains datasets used in the project.
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **/src:** Python scripts for specific functionalities.
- **/results:** Save model outputs, visualizations, and evaluation metrics.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mandarborkar2304/LendingClub-Loan-Repayment-Prediction.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the steps outlined in the notebooks to reproduce the analysis.
