The data includes information about the borrower's credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors.\n\nThe columns in the dataset represent the following:\n\n* credit.policy: Whether the borrower meets LendingClub.com's credit underwriting criteria.\n* purpose: The purpose of the loan (e.g., credit card debt consolidation, educational expenses, etc.).\n* int.rate: The interest rate of the loan.\n* installment: The monthly payment amount.\n* log.annual.inc: The natural log of the borrower's annual income.\n* dti: The debt-to-income ratio.\n* fico: The borrower's FICO credit score.\n* days.with.cr.line: The length of time the borrower has had a credit line.\n* revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance.\n* revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate.\n* inq.last.6mths: The number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n* delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.\n* pub.rec: The number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).\n* not.fully.paid: Whether the borrower repaid their loan in full (0) or not (1).\n\nThe data is from 2007-2010, so it may not be representative of the current lending environment. However, it is a valuable resource for understanding the factors that affect a borrower's likelihood of repayment.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import
